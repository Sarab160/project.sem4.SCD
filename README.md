🧭 NTU Smart Navigation System
A real-time, AI-powered smart campus navigation assistant for National Textile University (NTU). This system combines dynamic map routing, friend location sharing, and a responsive academic chatbot—all in one desktop experience.

📌 Project Summary
The NTU Smart Navigation System is built to help students and faculty navigate the NTU campus intelligently. It enhances campus life with features like:
•	Live GPS-based pathfinding
•	QR-code enabled friend finder
•	Chatbot support for academic queries
•	Weather integration and service quick-access
This cross-functional tool ensures that users always know where they are, where they're going, and how to get there.

🧩 Core Modules
🗺️ Dynamic Campus Mapping
•	Uses open-source map rendering tools to display campus buildings and roads.
•	Calculates optimized routes, including building entrances and service paths.
📍 Real-Time Friend Locator
•	Share your live campus location via QR code.
•	Friends can scan the code and view your current position on a web-based map.
•	Flask server enables real-time map sharing across devices.
💬 Academic Assistant Chatbot
•	Understands user queries related to subjects, rooms, schedules, and faculty.
•	Trained using natural language processing and custom datasets.
•	Built to respond to both general and university-specific questions.
☁️ Weather & Campus Info
•	Fetches current weather conditions for the NTU campus.
•	Suggests whether it’s safe to walk across campus in real-time.

🧠 Technology Stack
Area	Tools & Frameworks
UI	CustomTkinter, Tkinter
Maps	Folium, Leaflet.js, OSMnx, NetworkX
Backend	Flask, Threading, Requests, Webbrowser
AI/NLP	PyTorch, NLTK, custom-trained intent model
QR System	qrcode, Pillow
Weather	PyOWM (OpenWeatherMap API)

🧱 System Architecture
1.	Desktop App (GUI Layer): Handles all visual components and user interactions.
2.	Map Engine: Generates interactive HTML maps using geographical data.
3.	QR Generator: Encodes and decodes user locations to enable friend-finding.
4.	Flask Server: Launches a local server to serve shared maps.
5.	Chatbot Engine: Processes user queries and returns academic responses.

🧪 Functional Highlights
•	Shortest Route Calculation: Includes all access paths and avoids unreachable areas.
•	Cross-Building Navigation: Recognizes building-to-building movement logic.
•	Location Persistence: User’s location can be encoded, shared, and viewed later.
•	Multithreaded Operation: Keeps server, chatbot, and UI responsive simultaneously.
•	Multi-modal UI: Switch between navigation, assistant, and utilities effortlessly.

🎓 University Use Cases
Use Case	Description
New Student Orientation	Helps freshmen find lecture halls and service offices.
Faculty Assistance	Enables professors to locate department rooms or labs.
Friends Meetup	Share and follow live location on campus during events.
Class Schedule Lookup	Ask chatbot about today's classes and their respective rooms.
Real-time Weather Alerts	View campus-specific weather before heading to a destination.

🧠 Design Patterns Implemented
Pattern	Functionality
Singleton	Ensures shared services like weather or routing run as single instances.
Adapter	Integrates legacy data or alternative APIs.
Strategy	Switches routing logic (e.g., shortest time vs shortest distance).
State	GUI transitions smoothly across modes like “Navigation” and “Chatbot.”
Observer	Updates map view automatically when user location changes.
Decorator	Adds optional features to the map without altering base logic.
Facade	Provides a simplified interface for initiating services.
